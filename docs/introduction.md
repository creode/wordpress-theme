# Introduction
This project is a simple WordPress plugin containing the Creode WordPress Theme Framework.

## Plugin Features
This plugin provides a simple way to install the Creode WordPress Theme Framework. It contains functionality that will allow for the simple compilation and handling of assets. It can facilitate the following:

- Installation of the Creode WordPress Theme Framework
- Compilation of assets
- Providing a simple way to keep track of theme framework files and give a single location to manage SCSS and theme related files.
- Allow the sharing of new theme files and systems across multiple themes.

## Commands
This plugin provides a number of commands. These are associated with the syncronisation of theme framework files and the compilation of assets. You can find more details on these commands in the [commands](/commands) section.

## Upgrades from Theme Core
The theme core was a small framework that initially handled the compilation of assets and the enqueueing of scripts and styles. It was a small framework that was not designed to be used as a base for themes. Details of this can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/creode/wordpress-theme-core).

This package is designed to replace the theme core and provide a more robust framework for themes.

A guide on upgrading your theme from the theme core to the new framework can be found in the [migrating from theme core](/migrating-from-theme-core) section.
