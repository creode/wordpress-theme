# Match Height

## Introduction
Match Height is a jQuery plugin that automatically matches the heights of elements. This is particularly useful for creating uniform card layouts, grid systems, or any scenario where you need multiple elements to have the same height regardless of their content.

The library is automatically registered and available for both front-end and admin scripts, with jQuery as a dependency.

## Usage
For complete usage documentation, options, examples, and advanced features, please refer to the official [jquery-match-height repository](https://github.com/liabru/jquery-match-height).
